修改：settings.gradle 的内容

例如：只需要Dagger2 可以如下配置：

//include ':app'

//include ':DataStructure'

//include ':Arithmetic'

//include ':JavaBasics'

//include ':LeakCanary'

//include ':leakcanary'

//include ':blockcanary'

//include ':DesignMode'

//include ':eventbus'

//include ':Retrofit'

//include ':LeakCanary'

//include ':BlockCanary'

//include ':Okhttp'

//include ':Butterknife'

//include ':RxJava'

//include ':Volley'

//include ':Glide'

//include ':GreenDao'

//include ':JsBridge'

//include ':GpuImage'

//include ':MediaAv'
